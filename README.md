In this login system user can signup firstly as user or as client after successfully signup user can directly render to the login page.Then the user can login by thier own credentials.
In the login section you see the admin login but in the signup section you dont see the signup as admin because the admin is a superuser so we give the admin role permission through the backend.
So the user can login as admin.
